# IBM Cloud Terraform modules - Guidelines

This repo captures several guidelines to contribute to either existing repo or creating new repo under [terraform-ibm-modules](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules) org. 

## Guidelines

 We aspire to create a welcoming environment for collaboration with IBM Cloud Terraform modules. To do that we have defined following set of  guidelines

 * [Module Design Guidelines](design_guidelines.md)          :  based on certain characterstics we can design the module
 * [Implementation Guidelines](implementation_guidelines.md) :  creating a new module repo
 * [Contribution Guidelines](contribution_guidelines.md)     :  contributing to existing module
 * [Issue report Guidelines](issue_report_guidelines.md)     :  report an issue or request a feature

 ### What to capture at root module README file
 
 First and Foremost important step to follow before proceeding with module implementation is defining your README file with following points :
 
 * What is the scope of the module
 * Diagram capturing multiple sub-modules involved and their functionalities
 * What are the inputs module expects & the outputs we get back
 * List of variables it requires
 * Example showing how to consume the module
